**Description:**


This project implements a Face Mask Detection System using the MobileNetV2 architecture. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the system identifies and classifies individuals based on whether they are wearing face masks or not. This system serves as a valuable tool in contributing to public health safety measures, particularly in environments where the adherence to face mask mandates is crucial.


**Features:**


**MobileNetV2 Architecture:** Utilizes the MobileNetV2 architecture for efficient and accurate classification.


**Deep Learning:** Implements deep learning techniques to detect and classify face mask usage.


**Public Health Safety:** Contributes to public health safety measures by identifying individuals adhering to face mask mandates.


**Versatile Deployment:** Can be deployed in various environments to monitor and enforce face mask usage guidelines.


**Usage:**


**Training:** Train the model using a dataset of images labeled with individuals wearing and not wearing face masks.


**Testing:** Test the trained model on new images or video streams to detect face mask usage.


**Deployment:** Deploy the system in environments where monitoring and enforcing face mask usage is necessary.


**Requirements:**


Python 3.x


TensorFlow


Keras
OpenCV
